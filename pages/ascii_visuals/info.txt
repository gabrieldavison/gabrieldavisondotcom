One file generative visual system using text.

Dont try and use this on mobile.

Built this in bed when I had covid.

All one html file, unminified if you want to check the source.

The text box contains a function that is executed for each location on the grid of text.

The function should return a one character string.

You can use the functions arguments to decide what character to display.

Parameters to the function are as follows:

f = current frame
x/y = location on the grid
m = position of the mouse
