        At the end of April I got to work with PVA on the video for their song
        'Untethered'. I did the projections that were used as a backdrop for the
        video. These were made using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and
        then processed with
        <a href="https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra/">hydra</a>. I had a midi
        controller hooked up so that I could make changes as they played and
        sync the visuals up to the song. You can see the code I used
        <a href="https://github.com/gabrieldavison/pva_untethered_visuals"
          >here</a
        >. You'll have to make some changes to get it running though as it's
        expeciting to be hooked up to a midi controller and will throw an error
        if it's not plugged in.
