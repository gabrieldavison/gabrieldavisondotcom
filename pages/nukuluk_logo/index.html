      An animated logo I worked on for
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nukuluk_nukuluk/?hl=en"
        >@nukuluk_nukuluk</a
      >. This was projected during a live show. The model was rendered using
      <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and the processed with
      <a href="https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra">hydra</a>. I set up a few
      different processing chains and then toggled them at diffrent intervals,
      sometimes changing the speed of the interval itself. The chains are mostly
      modulation or feedback effects. If you click 'View Live" above you will be
      taken to an instance of the code I used to generate the video where you
      can see the effects applied in real time.
